# visualize_HYG_star_database
My entry to the [March 2018 DataViz Battle](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/825mg6/battle_dataviz_battle_for_the_month_of_march_2018/) is a histogram that bins the number of stars by color index and absolute visual magnitude, made with MATLAB R2018a. The figure was inspired by [this work](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zonination/h-r-diagram/master/twinkle.gif) by [u/zonination](https://www.reddit.com/user/zonination).
